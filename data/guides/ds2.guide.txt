Setup Guide for SuperCard DSTWO
If you are seeing this and you have not used FlashcartHelper to help set up your DSTWO, disregard this information.
This guide was made by ron975.

1)Drag everything in the "Put_In_SD_Card" (it should be open right now) into the ROOT of your MicroSD card.
2)Games and Homebrew can be anywhere you want in your MicroSD unless specified
3)Put your MicroSD card into your Supercard DSTWO
4)Insert your DSTWO into your DSi/DSlite/DSPhat
5)If you haven't flashed your DSTWO yet, no icon should show up. Leave your DSi/DSlite/DSPhat ON until an icon shows up. THIS IS EXTREMLY IMPORTANT!
6)Once an icon shows up, start your DSTWO
7)To play NDS files, start DS_Game from the menu you are at now
8)To play GBA games or SNES games, start NDSGBA or CATSFC, respectively

Note: You cannot download commercial GBA/SNES/NDS roms through FlashcartHelper
