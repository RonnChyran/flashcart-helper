Setup Guide for M3 Quad-Boot
If you are seeing this and you have not used FlashcartHelper to help set up your M3 Simply/M3 Real/M3i Zero, disregard this information.
This guide was made by ron975, 

1)Drag everything in the "Put_In_SD_Card" (it should be open right now) into the ROOT of your MicroSD card.
2)Games and Homebrew can be anywhere you want in your MicroSD unless specified
3)Put your MicroSD card into your M3
4)Insert your M3 into your DSi/DSlite/DSPhat
5)When you start your M3, you will boot into Sakura. Choose YSM3.nds to boot into YSMenu, Choose R4iRTS.nds to boot into R4iRTS. This may take a while. To boot into M3 Wood, choose wood_r4_m3.nds. Remember to go into the "start" menu, then settings, then change the save extension to .sav.
6)I recommened you to use YSM3, it has the best compatibility.
7)To boot moonshell in the R4iRTS menu, you have to rename moonshl2.nds to _DS_MSHL.NDS
