1)Drag everything in the "Put_In_SD_Card" (it should be open right now) into the ROOT of your MicroSD card.
2)Games and Homebrew can be anywhere you want in your MicroSD unless specified
3)Put your MicroSD card into your EZ-Flash 5
4)Insert your EZ-Flash 5 into your DSi/DSlite/DSPhat
4i)You need a game in your microSD card to start your EZ5
5)If you are using an EZ-Flash Vi, you may need to update your firmware. Plug in your DS, and run ez5firmwreUP_V101.nds. Make sure ez5isys.bin is also in your SD card before running ez5firmwreUP_V101.nds. If it says no need to update, shut down your DS immediatley, and delete ez5firmwreUP_V101.nds
6)Enjoy!
