1)Start DS-Scene Rom tool from the DS-Scene folder, or through FlashcartHelper
2)If it prompts you to update, click "Install Update". 
3)If it prompts you to update your "CMP Database" click "Install Update" This is the cheat database. If you have a CycloDS or iEdge, select it, otherwise, just select "USRCheat.dat"
4)Once it's done updating, click "Databases" from the top menu, then click "Install to media" and then select the  most appropiate option. If you have a CycloDS or an iEdge, select the option for your flashcart, for anyone else select the "USRCheat" option. The text should be similar to this : "USRCheat [2011-08-21]" Then select where you want the cheat database on your flashcart's MicroSD. This varies from flashcart to flashcart
5)You can also load a rom into the DS-Scene Rom Tool, and see its info, including whether it has anti-piracy, which it will patch if it can.


Note: You cannot download commercial GBA/SNES/NDS roms through FlashcartHelper
